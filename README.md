# discordbot

> An extensible and customizable Discord bot.

## Setting Up

To run this beast, you will need to setup very few (yes, you heard that right) configuration:

- Create a new file named `config.json` in the root directory.
- Copy the content of `config.example.json` and paste the content of the file inside the created file (`config.json`).
- You may delete the `config.example.json` file now.
